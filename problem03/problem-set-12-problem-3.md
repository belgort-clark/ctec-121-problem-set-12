# Module 7 - Problem Set No. 12 Problem 3

## Ocean Levels

Assuming that the ocean level is currently rising about 1.7 millimeters each year, create a Python program that displays the number of millimeters that the ocean will have risen each year for the next 25 years. Use f strings to display the output.

Be sure to display the number of the years starting at 1 along with the level.

Name your function **oceanLevels()**.
